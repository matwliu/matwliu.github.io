<!-- About Me -->
<!-- ====== -->

I am currently a Research Fellow in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.nus.edu.sg) at [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://nus.edu.sg). Before joining NUS, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [South China Research Center for Applied Mathematics and Interdisciplinary Studies (CAMIS)](http://camis.scnu.edu.cn/) at [South China Normal University](https://www.scnu.edu.cn). I received my PhD in 2020 and my BSc in 2014 from [Hunan Normal University](https://www.hunnu.edu.cn).


My research is at computational and applied mathematics with a main focus on scientific computing and numerical analysis. I am interested in combining analysis, partial differential equations, dynamical systems, algorithm design, numerical analysis and optimization techniques to nonlinear problems with applications in quantum physics and materials science. 

<!-- My recent research topics include (i) finding multiple saddle points for nonconvex functionals involving nonlinear partial differential equations, and (ii) computing stationary states of Bose-Einstein condensates based on nonlinear Schrödinger/Gross-Pitaevskii equations.  -->
