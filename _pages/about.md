<!-- About Me -->
<!-- ====== -->


I am currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics at [National University of Defense Technology (NUDT)](https://english.nudt.edu.cn/). Before joining NUDT in September 2024, I worked as a postdoc at [South China Normal University](https://www.scnu.edu.cn), [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg) and [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk). I received my PhD and BSc from [Hunan Normal University](https://www.hunnu.edu.cn) in 2020 and 2014 respectively. For more details please refer to my [CV](https://matwliu.github.io/cv).

My research is at computational and applied mathematics with a main focus on scientific computing and numerical analysis. I am interested in combining analysis, partial differential equations, dynamical systems, algorithm design, numerical analysis and optimization techniques to solve nonlinear problems with applications in quantum physics and materials science. 

<!-- My recent research topics include (i) finding multiple saddle points for nonconvex functionals involving nonlinear partial differential equations, and (ii) computing stationary states of Bose-Einstein condensates based on nonlinear Schrödinger/Gross-Pitaevskii equations.  -->
